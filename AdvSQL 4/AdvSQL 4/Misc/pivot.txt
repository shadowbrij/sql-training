Pivoting is a technique that groups and aggregates data, transitioning it from a state of rows
to a state of columns. In all pivot queries, you need to identify three elements:
¦¦ What do you want to see on rows? This element is known as the on rows, or grouping
element.
¦¦ What do you want to see on columns? This element is known as the on cols, or spreading
element.
¦¦ What do you want to see in the intersection of each distinct row and column value?
This element is known as the data, or aggregation element.

sy:
WITH PivotData AS
(
SELECT
< grouping column >,
< spreading column >,
< aggregation column >
FROM < source table >
)
SELECT < select list >
FROM PivotData
PIVOT( < aggregate function >(< aggregation column >)
FOR < spreading column > IN (< distinct spreading values >) ) AS P;
ex:return customer IDs on rows, shipper IDs on columns, and the total freight in
the intersections
WITH PivotData AS
(
SELECT
customerid , -- grouping column
shipvia, -- spreading column
freight -- aggregation column
FROM Orders
)
SELECT customerid, [1], [2], [3]
FROM PivotData
PIVOT(SUM(freight) FOR shipvia IN ([1],[2],[3]) ) AS P;

This query generates the following output (shown here in abbreviated form).
custid 1 2 3
------- -------- -------- --------
1 95.03 61.02 69.53
2 43.90 NULL 53.52
3 63.09 116.56 88.87
4 41.95 358.54 71.46
5 189.44 1074.51 295.57
6 0.15 126.19 41.92
7 217.96 215.70 190.00
8 16.16 175.01 NULL
9 341.16 419.57 597.14
10 129.42 162.17 502.36

Unpivoting:
Unpivoting data can be considered the inverse of pivoting. The starting point is some pivoted
data. When unpivoting data, you rotate the input data from a state of columns to a state of
rows
SELECT < column list >, < names column >, < values column >
FROM < source table >
UNPIVOT( < values column > FOR < names column > IN( <source columns> ) ) AS U;

ex:

uSE northwind;

IF OBJECT_ID('FreightTotals') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE Sales.FreightTotals;
GO
WITH PivotData AS
(
SELECT
customerid , -- grouping column
shipvia, -- spreading column
freight -- aggregation column
FROM Orders
)
SELECT *
INTO FreightTotals
FROM PivotData
PIVOT( SUM(freight) FOR shipvia IN ([1],[2],[3]) ) AS P;
--SELECT * FROM FreightTotals;
SELECT customerid, shipvia, freight
FROM FreightTotals
UNPIVOT( freight FOR shipvia IN([1],[2],[3]) ) AS U;


This query generates the following output (shown here in abbreviated form).
custid shipperid freight
------- ---------- --------
1 1 95.03
1 2 61.02
1 3 69.53
2 1 43.90
2 3 53.52
3 1 63.09
3 2 116.56
3 3 88.87
4 1 41.95
4 2 358.54
4 3 71.46
