A. Using SELECT to retrieve rows and columns 
The following example shows three code examples. This first code 
example returns all rows (no WHERE clause is specified) and all
columns (using the *) from the Product table in the 
AdventureWorks2012 database.

This example returns all rows (no WHERE clause is specified), and 
only a subset of the columns (Name, ProductNumber, ListPrice) from 
the Product table in the AdventureWorks2012 database. Additionally, 
a column heading is added.

B. Using SELECT with column headings and calculations 
The following examples return all rows from the Product table. The 
first example returns total sales and the discounts for each product. 
In the second example, the total revenue is calculated for each 
product.

The following example shows two ways to use the INDEX 
optimizer hint. The first example shows how to force the

a table, and the second example forces a table scan by using 
an index of 0.
